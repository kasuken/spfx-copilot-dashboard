# Current Notes

Web part or ACE (Dashboard) to retrieve all the SharePoint Agents from all the SharePoint sites in the tenant
- The agents can be filtered for the agents that the user can access
- The dashboard is configurable to be used by an Administrative user or from a standard user
- The user can open directly the Agent from the dashboard
- "Client" web part that receive the URL of the agent and open it up
- The dashboard web part can be configured to consume Search web part dataset 

## Future features to be implemented (to be transferred to issues list)

[] - Maybe adding an extension available in every lists and libraries that opens up a popup with the available agents/copilots
